# bcpMaker
Create custom VaultBCP packages via the coolOrange bcpDevkit.
This sample application shows how to create a custom VaultBCP package by leveraging the bcpDevkit. The application takes all the files from the source folder, exludes the configured file extensions, ignored the configured folders and applies the category rules configured in the config.xml file. Feel free to tweak and extend the application as required by your project, or reach out to coolOrange in case you need a custom version.
